# Data Preparation for Code Migration Research

This repository contains the data preparation process for my dissertation titled "Building a Generative Al-Powered Code Migration Pipeline for Application Modernisation". The aim of this research is to explore the capabilities of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in streamlining and enhancing code migration for application modernisation.

## Overview

The data preparation process involves collecting, organising, and preparing code artefacts from various programming languages such as Java, JavaScript and Objective-C. These artefacts will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of generative AI models in migrating code between different programming languages.

## File Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **code-artefacts/**: Contains the original code artefacts organised by programming language.
- **analysis-and-linter-results/**: Stores the results of static analysis and linter checks for each code artefact.
- **documentation/**: Contains documentation related to information on the source of code artifacts.

## Data Preparation Process

1. **Code Artefact Collection**: Code artefacts were collected from open-source repositories covering a range of programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, and Objective-C.

2. **Static Analysis and Linter Checks**: The collected code artefacts undergo static analysis and linter checks to assess code quality, adherence to coding standards, and potential issues.

3. **Usage in Code Migration Pipeline**: The code artefacts serve as the dataset for the code migration pipeline, where generative AI models will be applied to migrate code from Java to Kotlin, JavaScript to Python, JavaScript to TypeScript, and Objective-C to Swift.
